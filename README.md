# dequoted

A [quota](https://forstasurveys.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10100597040795-Adding-Quotas-Using-the-XML-Editor) generator for [Decipher / Forsta Surveys](https://demo.forsta.com/surveys/)

## ~~warning~~

~~At the moment the output of `dequoter-web` can't be used as imported JSON code in `dequoter-py`.~~

The JSON output of `dequoter-web` can now be used for `dequoter-py`. :)

### to-do

- [ ] maybe generate `.xls` files directly?
    - [ ] `dequoter-py`
    - [ ] `dequoter-web`
- [ ] tests?
